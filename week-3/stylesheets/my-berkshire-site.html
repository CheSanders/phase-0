<!-- 
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

I'd say it's important to spell everything correctly when linking an external file to an HTML file. I had a typo and it took longer than it should have to realize why my CSS file wasn't linking to my HTML file.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It was actually very hard to get the site to look as I wanted it to. My partner and I hit a lot speedbumps during this assingments. I didn't use any tricks, but instead a lot of research and asking questions. 

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We used classes and ID's to modify the element style. Yes, we did modify the HTML to include classes and ID's. We chose to use both, because we wanted to practice using them and found them pretty useful. 

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I'm not entirely sure. Our code looks a lot longer than the actual code base that the website used.
