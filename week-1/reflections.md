1.1 Think About Time Reflection

-Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

I learned all of these last phase. It's a lot harder to implement though!

-What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time Boxing is setting up specific times to do work. After the time is up, you can take a break. You can use this for long assignments in Phase 0. I highly recommend it. 

-How do you manage your time currently?
Terribly.

-Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

Nope, fell behind in my last cohort.

-Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

I'm going to use more timeboxing and get a tutor to keep me on track. 

-What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

Implement these tips we're learning about time management. 



1.2 The Command Line Reflection

-What is a shell? What is "bash?  

"shell" is any software that provides an interface to an operating system. Bash is a specific example of a command-line shell

-What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
Nothing

-Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes

-In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

All of them. Last cohort I used almost each one on a regular basis.

-Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd Prints working directory

-ls list all 

-mv move a file

-cd change directory

-../ move to last directory

-touch create a file 

-mkdir makes directory-rmdir remove directory

-rm remove

-help bring up help screen

1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  

-If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

1. To create a new repo you simply click the plus sign in the top right corner and click create repo.

2. To fork a repo click "fork repo" on the top right corner.

3. To clone a repo you can use the git clone command on your command line. 

You fork a repository as opposed to create one because it already gives you somebody else's draft as your own. If you created a new one you would be starting from scratch. 

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I had no struggles setting up git and GitHub. I learned most of everything in my last cohort.
