Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

In the upper right corner of the GitHub page you click the add buttion and choose "New repository". You then Create a name for your repository. For example, "hello-world". Optionally, you can add a description of your repository. You then select whether you repository is public or private. Finally, you click 'Create repository. In order to clone your repository you need to open up your terminal and type in git clone 'name of repository'. It will then clone the repostitory to your computer. 

Describe what open source means.

Open source is when the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or 
protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I like the idea of Open Source. It doesn't make me nervous or protective, because if I was working on a project that I didn't want anybody to be aware of or work on, then I would take the proper steps to protect my work. Open Source seems like a way to work on something that is non-profit oriented, while at the same time allowing others to work on it also. It does feel like utopia, because it seems that it could be an idealistic way of thinking. For example, has anything ever gone wrong or somebodies idea was stolen because it was Open Source?

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses allow others to help you, while at the same time maintaining copyright of your work. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I was able to get more of a grasp on pushing files to GitHub. I had an "aha" moment when fully grasping the concept of staging a git file. From there you are able to push it onto GitHub. I'm still struggling with pull requests, but I plan to get help on that tomorrow. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I was fortunate enough to recieve a ton of help via slack from my coding corps teammates. They were extremely helpful and willing to help.
