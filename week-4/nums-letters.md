-What does puts do?

-What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number. Ex: 1,23,402,1000
 A flot is a decimal number. Ex: 0.21, 1.3, 3.14159 

-What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The difference between float and integer division is the answer. For example, 9 divided by 2 will give the answer 4 (not 4.5). This is because float isn't a valid answer for many questions. For example, if you have $9 and a movie is $2, you can't see 4.5 movies (you can see 4).

-What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are lines of text. For example, 'This is a simple Ruby string'. You use strings to write your lines of code. 

-What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variales hold information. For example, my_name = Ché Sanders, age = 21. You could use them writing the variables in a string. Puts 'my name is + my_name' + 'I am + age' 

This will print out "my name is Ché Sanders I am 21"
