-What is a wireframe?

A skeletal three-dimensional model of a website's structure. 

-What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireraming is a great way to get started building a website. It's similar to the blueprint of a house. You can get an idea of where you want certain content to go and how it will look. 

-Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I used a basic template for wireframing my site. Since, we can't have our blog posts show on a single webpage, I imagined having mulitple links leading to each blog post from the "blog index".

-Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I stuck with the first wireframe. I didn't have any questions during this challenge.

-Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I found making the wireframe tedious. Next time I'm going to use pen and paper and scan it.
