What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal or purpose would be to share my work history, background, passions, and past projects as well as a blog. The content my site will feature is links to my social networks (twitter, facebook, LinkedIn, Quora, GitHub etc.), my picture, my contact information, about me, and any of my projects. 

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

If the website we're going to build is to share things about ourselves, then I see my site addressing those things very easily. The content will directly address that. Our target audience's interests will be to find things out about ourselves and possibly hire us. 

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary "action" should be able to see my portfolio. I would then want them to be able to have link to contact me, find more information about me, and see my social networks. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Somebody should be able to know that design is how your website looks and user experience is how your website makes somebody feel. 

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is how the website makes somebody feel and the initial experience they have while browsing your site. This is very valuable because different target audiences will have different user expierences. For example, websites with a younger target audience will need to be more visual and stimulating. The user expierence will be very important for a site geaered towards young people, than a site that is geared towards older adults (Bank websites, Work websites, etc.)
