<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was fun. HTML is pretty direct and straightfoward. It is definitely an organizational language, but I believe that's what makes it pretty simple to grasp. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was good. HTML5 semantics is simpler to use than HTML4 semantics. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Just making sure that I follow the directions and go one step at a time. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is very clear and easy to use. The only downside is that it's a pretty basic langauge and seems to leave your site boring. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I've created an HTML template that I refer to in case I forget the correct order.
