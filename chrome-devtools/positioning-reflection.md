-How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrom DevTools allows web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. You can use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.

-How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You assign a class or ID to that specific element and resize it from there.

-What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

A static element is not positioned in any way. A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. A fixed position is When you want to keep an element in the same spot in the viewport no matter where on the page the user is. Absolute behaves like fixed except relative 
to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. I found relative positing easiest to use because it moved along with the other shapes when making changes. I found absolute positing the most difficult to use. 

-What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border. 

-What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I disliked this challenge. I got the hang of devtools, but didn't exactly enjoy it. The equidistant portion of the assignment got tedious for me.
